* The most common methods to address missing data in time series are: 

### Imputation
When we fill in missing data based on observations about the entire data set.

### Interpolation
When we use neighboring data points to estimate the missing value. Interpolation can also be a form of imputation.

### Deletion of affected time periods
When we choose not to use time periods that have missing data at all


## Smoothing Data
Smoothing data can be done for a variety of reasons, and often real-world time series data is smoothed before analysis, especially for visualizations that aim to tell an understandable story about the data.
